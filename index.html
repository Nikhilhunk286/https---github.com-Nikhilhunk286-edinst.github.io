      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">India has made great strides in improving access to quality education, increasing elementary school enrollment and reducing the number of out-of-school children.These achievements have been bolstered by key laws, policies and programmes such as the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act (2009), the National Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Policy (2013). However, challenges do remain and at EDUTECH we want to leap forward indian population  by providing them best education via modern technology and strengthen india's one of the key pillars.</p></div>
